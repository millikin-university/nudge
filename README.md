# Nudge (macadmin's Slack [#nudge](https://macadmins.slack.com/archives/CDUU7DJQ2))
Nudge is a multi-linguistic application, offering custom user deferrals, which strongly encourages macOS updates. Written in Swift and SwiftUI.

Nudge will only work on macOS Big Sur 11 and later and is a replacement for the original Nudge, which was written in Python 2/3. If you need to enforce macOS updates for earlier versions, it is recommended to use [nudge-python](https://github.com/macadmins/nudge-python).

For more information about installation, deployment, and the user experience, please see the [wiki](https://github.com/macadmins/nudge/wiki).
